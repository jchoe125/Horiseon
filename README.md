# Horiseon
Homework Assignment #1

Homework description:
* For this assignment, improvements were made to existing code without changing what it does to meet a certain set of standards as described by the acceptance criteria, ie refactoring code to make it more accessible. Best efforts were made to leave the code cleaner than it was originally.

Rationale:
* As an increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

To impress clients, the codebase should be improved for long-term sustainability, for example:
* checking that all links are functioning correctly
* increasing the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
* including comments before each element or section of the page.

Goals:
* Refactoring a provided codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines so that:
  * Semantic HTML elements are found in the source code
  * Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  * Accessible alt attributes are found in the icon and image elements
  * Heading attributes fall in sequential order
  * Title element contains a concise, descriptive title
